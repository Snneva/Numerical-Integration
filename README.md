# Numerical Integration in MATLAB

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and reports for performing **numerical integration** using various methods. The project demonstrates how to approximate definite integrals when analytical solutions are difficult or impossible to obtain.

## Methods Included

1. **Riemann Sum**
   - Left Riemann Sum
   - Right Riemann Sum
   - Midpoint Riemann Sum

2. **Trapezoidal Rule**

3. **Simpson's Rule**

4. **Monte Carlo Integration**

Each method approximates the integral of a function over a given interval, allowing comparison of accuracy and efficiency.

## Features

- MATLAB scripts to compute integrals for a user-defined function.
- Comparison of approximate integral values with exact results.
- Visualization of function plots and error analysis.
